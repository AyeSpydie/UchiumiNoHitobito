  "description": "Graung's Guide to Golarion: Inner Sea Ancestries Expanded adds over 100 new ancestry feats and several new heritages for Azarketi, Fetchlings, Fleshwarps, Sprites, and Strix. It also includes a revamped Dogfolk ancestry, allowing for Shoony who can be based upon any breed of dog, rather than just pugs. In addition, there are two new ancestry specific archetypesâ€” the Fleshforged Warrior Fleshwarp for those who wish to play a heavy hitting living weapon and the Strix Rokoa for those who wish to play as the spiritual leader of their people.",
